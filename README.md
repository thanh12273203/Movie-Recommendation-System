# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a Movie Recommendation System implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. It leverages the `ratings.csv` dataset to provide movie recommendations based on user preferences and ratings.

## Dataset
The `ratings.csv` file contains user ratings for various movies. This data is crucial for training the recommendation model and drawing insights about user preferences.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, scikit-surprise, matplotlib, seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Ensure Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed on your system.
3. Install the required Python libraries mentioned above.
4. Open the `Movie Recommendation System.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
5. Run the notebook cells to follow the recommendation system's implementation and generate movie recommendations.

## Notebook Contents
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Collaborative filterings, singular value decomposition (SVD)
- Recommendation system hyperparamter tuning and evaluation
